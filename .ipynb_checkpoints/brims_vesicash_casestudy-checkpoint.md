# VesiCash:  Caveat emptor no more

## Investment Thesis
* Digital escrow expected to drive growth of e-commerce.  Despite a high internet and smartphone penetration into Nigeria, online sales have lagged, with a lack of trust between buyer and seller often cited as a principal reason (1trust).  Digital Escrow helps derisk both parties, by assuring the seller of future payment, but locks up that payment until the buyer receives and is satisfied with the authenticity of the  goods.  We believe this technology would help to drive adoption of e-commerce in Africa, similar to AliPay increasing the confidence of Chinese consumers in the integrity of BABA’s platform.  While there are several escrow players in Nigeria but we believe they can all be supported in the market by the significant growth potential in the online customer base. In Africa.   

* A one stop shop for third party payment solutions can drive adoption and retention of users. Fundamentally, digital escrow provides a risk mitigated approach to money transfers by acting as a gate point between the parties, and we expect they could leverage their existing architecture to also provide classical B2C payment services similar to PayPal or P2P money transfers similar to Venmo.  Also, in Nigeria and much of Africa, more than half of the population is unbanked(2 banking stat), and  we believe offerince mobile wallet services, would synergize with both their broader payment platform to make the Vesicash a one stop shop for all payment needs.  

* Expansion throughout Western Africa will increase the addressable population and expand throughout africa.  Nigeria is Africas’ largest economy, but e-commerce has been growing throughout western Africa, with not just in the affluent population but also the emerging middle class (3mckinsey). We believe the same trust issues which have hindered e-commerce are present in these other emerging markets.  Since their service should easily slots into existing payment paradigm, a priori, we believe it would be relatively simple to expand their geographic footprint.

## Overview and Origin

* Name:  Vesicash Financial Technology
![Vesicash_logo](./images/logo.png) 

* incorporated May 14, 2018 in Lagos, Nigeria

* Founders: Aigiomawu Ehiaghe, Ibrahim B. Oladele, Tomisin Adeshiyan (4 crunchbase)

* Company origin:  As students at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology, the founders looked at pain points for the growth of e-commerce in Nigeria.  The founders realized everyone they knew had been a victim of online fraud, which led them to founding a company which would enforce a level of trust between buyers and sellers.  After further researching different approaches, they settled on digital escrow.(5 interview)  

* Funding:  The initial pre-seed capital of 100k USD, which allowed Vesicash to initiate operations was obtained by both self funding (~20k USD) and from an investment from the founder’s entrepreneur program, The Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (6self funded,4).  The company  is now a VC backed company with the closed of their seed round of financing with Ingressive Capital as the lead investor on February 21, 2020.  While the size of this round has not been disclosed, we believe it at least doubled their amount raised, since Ingressive’s minimum check size is 100k USD (6).

## Business Activities


* Fintech solution: In developed countries ecommerce has revolutionized how we shop.  With the convenience of being able to buy everything from take-out from our favorite restaurant while on our way home on the subway to the real estate that we call home, there is not one area of commerce unaffected and in the two largest markets of North America and Asia, online revenues amounted ~1.288T USD.  Other geographies, though, have not seen the same astronomical flux through the online channel, and with revenues of 45B USD, e-commerce in Africa is only ~8% of North America (7 growth).

Commerce depends on trust with buyers wanting to know they are getting value for money and sellers expecting they will be paid for their merchandise.  The legal principle of Caveat emptor, quia ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum emit ("Let a purchaser beware, for he ought not to be ignorant of the nature of the property which he is buying from another party” has been part of common law since Roman time and basically says that the buyer is obligated to do their diligence, to try equalizing the asymmetry of information before the transaction is finalized.  This diligence and building of trust was much easier in a physical market place when transactions were done face to face, but in the digital sphere diligence is nearly impossible (how many of us can trust any review of a potential restaurant, fearing they were either written by management or by competitors?).   In the developing world this lack of trust is compounded by loser consumer protections or lack of options for redressing grievances, and nearly every Nigerian either has been the victim of fraud or knows someone who has (5).  We believe this lack of trust in ecommerce is a major factor which has retarded the growtn of ecommerce in Africa as illustrated by a survay showing 58% of potential online shoppers are concerned about recieving the good for which they paid (1). 

![consumer_trust](./images/trust.png)

Initial attempts to combat online scams involved payment being due on delivery.  This had the unintended effect of putting all the risk on the seller and nearly 75% of transactions are either underpaid or not paid at all (5).  In this environment, a new crop of African entrepreneurs have chosen to leverage the lessons learned during the growth of BABA in Asian.  When BABA was founded in 1999, they also had to fight a lack of trust in online shopping due to the chinese market being rife with fraud and counterfeit goods.  Their solution was to launch the payment and digital escrow service, AliPay, in 2003, which was successful in boosting sales through their platform (8 BABA).        
Digital escrow is a simple concept.  The escrow service acts as an impartial referee sitting in the payment channel between the buyer and seller.  Using the escrow service, at the time of transaction, the buyer submits their full payment for the goods or services.  Rather than being directly transferred to the seller, they are held in the virtual safekeeping of the escrow service, who notifies the seller of the receipt of the funds.  With the knowledge that they will receive full payment, the seller ships their goods to the buyer.  Once the Buyer receives and accepts the goods, the funds are then released to the seller completing the sale.  
This paradigm protects both the buyer and seller. 

- The escrow service uses a secure payment service, protecting the        buyers financial information.
* Since payment is given upfront, the buyer is confident that they will be paid in full upon acceptance of the goods.
* Once the goods are received by the buyer, they are able to conduct their diligence, giving them confidence in the legitimacy of the good, satisfying Caveat emptor.
* By using a fintech approach, this entire payment and release process can be automated and streamlined for a seamless user experience as well as low cost. (9 escrow)




* Who is the company's intended customer?  Nigeria has 190 million people of which 40% are online (10 cell phone).   Since 2017 there has been a 20% CAGR in the number of online purchases, reaching 77million in 2019 (11 internet), which we believe are a mix of first time and recurrent internet shoppers.  With a product like Vesicash, the goal would be to give the first time users a problem free experience, which will drive their conversion to recurrent users, and loyal Vesicash customers.

In Nigeria 30m individules have smart phones and this population is expected to increase at a 13% CAGR (10).  A good predictor of online shopping habits is the possession of a smartphone.  In one survey, 90% of smart phone have used their phone for online shopping, with 51% using their phone for at least one purchase a month (12).  As the growth of smartphones continues to increase so will these consumers, so any product Vesicash offers, needs to be compatible with mobile platforms.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape

* Domain:  Payment and ecommerce space.

* Domain innovations: The greatest innovations in the space have come from the advent of blockchain facilitated smart contracts and the payment with cryptocurrencies.  Additional innovations in the space have been P2P money transfers and e-wallets, which could be a potential boon to the unbanked populations in developing countries.

* Competition: Digital escrow is a rapidly growing area and competitive market in Africa with  Middletrust (est. Aug 2018 in Nigeria), Escrow Kenya (est, Oct. 2018 in Kenya), Lockmycash (Est. 2016 in Nigeria), payscrow(est. Feb.2017 in Nigeria).  Additional ex-Africa companies exist, most notably AliPay, within BABA


## Results

* Business Results:  In the first year of operations, the company has processed transactions worth ~20k USD with tiered commission rates ranging from 1.5-2.5%, which can be paid for by either party(13).  
* Metrics: Key metrics to watch in this space would be a) value of transactions processed and revenue to the firm, b) Merchants using the platform, and c) customer base. 
  
* Performance compared to peer group:  Digital escrow is a young space and Vesicash and their competitors are all very young startups, with little data in the public domain.  We believe they are fairly competitive with their peer group. In the first year of operations Middletrust signed up 20 merchants (14), which in an interview, the Vesicash CEO claimed to have signed up 60 merchants in the first 9 months of operations (7).  Also both Escrow Kenya and VesiCash claim to have signed up thousands of customers, but Escrow Kenya has processed ~81K USD in transactions over 1.5 years (15) compared to Vesicash processing 20K USD in the first year, but we believe part of this difference arises from 73% of Kenyans using mobile money compared to only 6% in Nigeria, giving the unbanked much more access to online shopping (16)  

## Recommendations:

* Recommendations for expanding their offerings: Classical online payment services similar to PayPal, P2P money transfers similar to Venmo mobile wallet services  
* Rationale for additional offerings:  We believe by definition a digital escrow company must be an independent third party, not tied to any specific ecommerce site, but strictly an intermediary facilitating the flow of money for goods.  While the digital escrow has an extra step of locking up the payment until certain conditions are met, it is ultimately just shepherding the flow of cash from one entity to another.  If the escrow element is removed, then you simply have either P2P or B2C cash flows, leveraging the same infrastructure.  Also, the ability to securely process payments and account information is integral to a payment system, and since much of Africa is unbanked, offering an e-wallet would have synergies and make VesiCash into a one stop shop for the customers payment needs.   


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?  We believe there is no need for Vesicash to reinvent the wheel.  The technologies for all the offerings we propose (escrow, B2C payment, P2P payment, and e-wallets have already been developed and validated.  Now it just comes down to using those technologies in this new geography.  The larger hurdle is the marketing efforts needed to drive adoption.
